# A Lottery smartcontract

1. Players can enter the lottery by depositing some ETH
2. After a specific time interval, a winner in randomly selected
3. The lottery is reset, and players can re-enter again

# Deployment to a testnet or mainnet

1. Setup environment variabltes

You'll want to set your `RINKEBY_RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY` as environment variables. You can add them to a `.env` file, similar to what you see in `.env.example`.

- `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of your account (like from [metamask](https://metamask.io/)). **NOTE:** FOR DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE USE A KEY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY REAL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
  - You can [learn how to export it here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key).
- `RINKEBY_RPC_URL`: This is url of the rinkeby testnet node you're working with. You can get setup with one for free from [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?a=673c802981)

2. Get testnet ETH

Head over to [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/) and get some tesnet ETH & LINK. You should see the ETH and LINK show up in your metamask. [You can read more on setting up your wallet with LINK.](https://docs.chain.link/docs/deploy-your-first-contract/#install-and-fund-your-metamask-wallet)

3. Setup a Chainlink VRF Subscription ID

Head over to [vrf.chain.link](https://vrf.chain.link/) and setup a new subscription, and get a subscriptionId. You can reuse an old subscription if you already have one. 

[You can follow the instructions](https://docs.chain.link/docs/get-a-random-number/) if you get lost. You should leave this step with:

1. A subscription ID
2. Your subscription should be funded with LINK

3. Deploy

In your `helper-hardhat-config.js` add your `subscriptionId` under the section of the chainId you're using (aka, if you're deploying to rinkeby, add your `subscriptionId` in the `subscriptionId` field under the `4` section.)

Then run:
```
yarn hardhat deploy --network rinkeby
```

And copy / remember the contract address. 

4. Add your contract address as a Chainlink VRF Consumer

Go back to [vrf.chain.link](https://vrf.chain.link) and under your subscription add `Add consumer` and add your contract address. You should also fund the contract with a minimum of 1 LINK. 

5. Register a Chainlink Keepers Upkeep

[You can follow the documentation if you get lost.](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-keepers/compatible-contracts/)
